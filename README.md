## 🌍 Project Overview

CarbonYield is a modern climate-tech platform enabling individuals to symbolically fund verified carbon sequestration projects and transparently track their environmental impact.

Unlike traditional carbon offset programs, CarbonYield emphasizes:

- **Symbolic reinvestment:** You don’t just donate — you gain credit to fund more change.
- **Transparency:** You see how your symbolic credits are issued, tracked, and retired.
- **Gamification:** Earn badges and track your carbon reduction journey.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> There’s currently no transparent, trust-first tool that lets people participate meaningfully in the carbon credit space.  
> CarbonYield is an ethical alternative for those who want to fund climate action and see their impact evolve.
